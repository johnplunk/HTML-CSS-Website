  I have always been very involved with my local community, as I was raised as a Boy Scout! Since elementary school, I have always been involved
    with the <a href="https://www.scouting.org/">Boy Scouts</a> in some way, either by actually being one or being involved with the Students Serving Scouting organization here
      at Texas A&M. For some relevant information about what we do, click the picture on the right!
