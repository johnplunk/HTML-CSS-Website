  <p class="profBodyBox">
    Here at Texas A&M University, I have pursued a Computer Engineering degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. I have also pursued 
      Cybersecurity and Math minors from their respective departments. Since September 2018, I have been a member of the IEEE,
        and I participated in their <a href="https://tamumake.com/">TAMUMake</a> hackathon in the 2019 spring semester. 
    <br><br>
    I have also been a student technician with the <a href="https://www.bio.tamu.edu/biology-information-technology-services/">Texas A&M Biology IT</a> department. During my time there, I have been part of a "3-man army" (two sysadmins and I) to keep the computers
      in the Biology department at a professional standard. From university sponsored labs to professor's private laptops, I have maintained and managed upkeep of
        over 600 different systems in the department. I have solved dozens of problems related to this technology- both software-side and hardware-side. 
          Because of the breadth of this job, I have been able to see problems from both a technical side and a functional side for the staff and faculty.
    <br><br>
    On the class-side of things, I have taken many different classes that are very relevant to the positions I would be seeking. My time in classes such as
      Digital Integrated Circuit Design and Microprocessor System Design has taught me a great deal about the hardware in the computers we use every day,
        while my time in classes such as Data Structures and Progamming Studio has given me a strong coding background. These classes, labs, and projects
          have all strengthened my background in the field of Computer Engineering, and they have given me a larger view of the field as a whole.
    <br><br>
    In time, I hope to contribute to the technical side of low-level integrated circuit design. I have enjoyed working with these components in labs and I hope  
      to improve my skills with them over time. My goal would eventually be to be designing or developing integrated circuits for either
        a big company or a research lab.
