    Howdy!
    <br><br>
    My name is John Plunk and I am a student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. I am a student in the <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/degrees/undergraduate/bs-ce.html">Electrical And Computer Engineering</a> department, and I am a Computer Engineering
      major. I am also planning on receiving a minor in both Cybersecurity and Math! I am also a student tech in the Biology Department,
       working for their IT division with two sysadmins. I'm also an Eagle Scout!
    <br><br>
    I am from a small town up in Fort Worth, Texas called <a href="https://www.aledo-texas.com/">Aledo</a>. Born in 1999 to be the youngest of three children, I have always been in interested in STEM fields. As a 
      young Cub Scout, my favorite part of the year was when we would hold the Pinewood Derby races. My dad and I would hop the fence to secretly use my neighbors
        workshop to create a wooden car for the races. 
    <br><br>
    In high school, I graduated in 2017 in the top 10% of my class. I was an officer of the <a href="https://www.musichonors.com/">Tri-M Music Honor Society</a> and a member of the <a href="https://www.nhs.us/">NHS</a>. I was also in marching
      band, concert band, and jazz band! I exceled in my Computer Science classes, and I was able to achieve the Eagle Scout rank in my senior year of high school.
    <br><br>
    These days, you'll find me here at Texas A&M studying my heart out in my STEM classes. When I'm not studying and going to class, I attend <a href="https://ieee-tamu.org/">IEEE</a> events (and hackathons!) and 
      help front the service organization Students Serving Scouting as vice-president. When I'm not backpacking or camping on weekends, you'll find me 
        watching bad TV shows and movies with my roommates (our guilty pleasure), or playing tennis with friends!
